# Customer Segmentation using RFMV

## Install

```
python -m env venv dev
source dev/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Intent

An improved version of RFM is available in the academic world,
using the **V**ariety - the number of distincts products - to try to better understand how the customers may interact with us.

In addition to this new modelisation, some researchers introduced new matrixes to project and display the customers with the aim of help Marketing teams define actions.

From a Machine Learning point of view, I'll will check if the clusters obtained using Unsupervised Learning are better with the most common model : KMeans.

Else, I'll explore others common models like CAH and Gaussian Mixture Models.

Finally, I'll contribute code able to generate the relevant visual matrixes required for Marketing actions.
